🚀 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Course Syllabus
📚 Overview
Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming! 🌍 As Heraclitus said, "There is nothing permanent except change." In software development, we face constant updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. 💻💡 Software maintenance can be expensive, but with the right approach, we can make this process more efficient and cost-effective.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows us to write more flexible and maintainable code, making it easier to adapt to changes without starting from scratch. 🔄

📖 Course Description
In this course, you'll learn the foundational concepts of OOP, including:

🏗️ Classes and Objects: The building blocks of OOP. These will help you organize your code in a modular and reusable way.
🔐 Encapsulation: Grouping data and functions together, and controlling access to them for better security and organization.
🧬 Inheritance: Sharing behaviors between classes, reducing code duplication and making your code more extendable.
🌀 Polymorphism: Allowing different objects to respond to the same method call, improving flexibility and scalability.
🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, you'll be able to:

Create and use classes and objects in your code. 🛠️
Implement encapsulation to hide implementation details. 🔒
Use inheritance to create hierarchical relationships between classes. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
Apply polymorphism to handle multiple object types with a single method. 🔄
